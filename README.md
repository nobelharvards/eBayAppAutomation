# eBayAppAutomation
eBay Android app automation exercise for buying a 65 inch TV.

An instance of Appium server must be running and eBay app must be installed on emulator or phone (package name `com.ebay.mobile`).

Tested on Appium 1.13.0 and eBay app 5.32.1.0 (03 June 2019).

Run by either `cd`ing to the MobileApplicationAutomationExercise directory in a terminal then `mvn test`, or importing into an IDE as a Maven project.

The test is fragile. Things like the button IDs can change from run to run for no apparent reason or pattern.
